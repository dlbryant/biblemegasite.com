I received an email from the webmaster of Studylight.com stating that Biblica, the publishers of the NIV, have demanded that he remove the NIV1984 from his site.

<BR><BR>  

Sadly, I knew that this day would come.  Biblica has been zealous to remove the NIV1984 from bookstores and online.  Why?  Because the NIV1984 is so popular that it would decrease sales of the new NIV2011.  Biblica sees sales instead of souls.

<BR><BR>

Biblica fails to see that the NIV1984 is the Word of God to millions.  Just because it has been revised doesn't make the NIV1984 any less than God's Word.

<BR><BR>

The webmaster at Studylight.com is also removing the NIV2011 in protest.  Good for him!

<BR><BR>

I have other resources of the NIV1984 at the <A HREF="https://biblemegasite.com/bible-library.html#niv""change-hyperlink-color.php" style="color:blue">NIV 1984/2011 Section</A> of the Bible Reference Library.  These include PDFs and Audio files of the NIV1984.

I am afraid that without Studylight, the interactive outlines of the NIV1984 and the NIV1984/NIV2011 parallel BIble are dead.  Please visit my site anyway, as I have no say in what Biblica does in its mission to kill the NIV1984. David Bryant

This is the email I received from the webmaster of Studylight.com:

Hello,

I am the owner/operator of StudyLight.org and I am writing to give you a heads up that I will be removing both the NIV and NIV’84 from my website.

I am taking this action since Biblica (the copyright owners) has made the removal of the NIV84 a condition of permission for the NIV.  Rather than removing only the NIV84 edition, I will be removing both.

Please feel free to express your displeasure to Biblica.com regarding their demands. 

Personally I feel that they are showing a lack of thankfulness to all those who helped to support them over the years by demanding the removal of this beloved edition of the NIV.
