<H1><center>A WORD OF CAUTION &#45 ACTS 17:11</center></H1>

<H2>Acts 17:11  Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. 
<P>
I urge you to examine my site's content with the Bible itself. 
<P>
Two sites that need careful examination with the Scriptures are biblestudy.org and so4j.com    
<P>
While biblestudy.org has excellent content on the life of Jesus and Paul, the website is from a religious organization that combine elements of Judaism and Christianity.  They also falsely teach that one receives the Holy Spirit at baptism by the laying on of hands.
<P>
So4J.com has excellent charts about Jesus, however, they have videos from false teachers and teach the unbiblical doctrines of election and the rapture.
<P>
My Bible Megasite will direct you to what is good about biblestudy.org and so4j.com, so please visit the good places of those two websites and ignore the other content from biblestudy.org and so4j.com. 
<P>
In my Reference Works Library, please examine the commentaries and the apologetics sites with the Bible, so you won’t be misled by them.  While they teach much truth, they definitely contain false doctrine.
<P>
And while I’m a member of the church of Christ, I encourage you to check the content of sites labeled "church of Christ" with the Bible in the spirit of Acts 17:11.  No church should fear being examined by the Bible, except those who teach false doctrine.
<P>
If you have any questions about the sites mentioned above, or any question in general about David's Bible Megasite, or any question about the Bible, please e-mail me at david1970(at)charter.net
