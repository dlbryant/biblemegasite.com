<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE KING JAMES/NEW KING JAMES VERSION</H1></center><P><P>

<BR><BR>

<h2> Perhaps the most beautiful and literary book in history is the King James Version. I have an healthy respect for the KJV, as it kept the church afloat during the 270 years when ir was the only major English translation.


<BR><BR>

However, it is an very outdated Bible translation.  English has changed in 400 years and the KJV has over 800 words that have changed meaning or no longer used. For example "let" in the KJV, now has the opposite meaning of "prevent,"  As much as the KJV is beloved, it gives off the false impression that the Bible is hard to read, when it is just the KJV translation that is hard to read.

<BR><BR>

The New King James Version fixes those 800 words and is a beautiful Bible to read.  However the NKJV uses the same manuscript base as the KJV, and does not use the 5000+ older manuscripts that the modern translations use. The KJV and NKJV uses the Latin Vulgate (an ancient Latin translation) for some places in Revelation, resulting in verses that are not supported by any Greek manuscript.  

<BR><BR>

The NKJV has textual differences in its footnotes.  If you do serious study with the NKJV, keep your eye on those footnotes.

<BR><BR>

WHile the KJV/NKJV doesn't use the oldest manuscipts, it is probably the most beautiful in when ircomes to literary style.

<BR><BR>

You will not find doctrinal errors in the KJV or NKJV, so I would highly recommend the KJV/NKJV for devotional reading, but for serious study, I would recommend the New American Standard Bible, English Standard Version, or the Lexham English Bible (found on the Bible Gateway).

<BR><BR>

What matters in a Bible translation is not about older manuscrpts that a translation may or may not use, but tather whether that translation will help you reach Heaven and the KJV/NKJV are two versions that will lead millions to Heaven.
