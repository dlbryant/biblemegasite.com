<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE HOLMAN CHRISTIAN STANDARD BIBLE</h1></center><P><P>

<BR<<BR>

<h1> I only have a couple of criticisms of the HCSB, an otherwise excellent translation.

<BR<BR>

In Acts 22:16 most translations say that Paul is told "be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord."  The HCSB says "be baptized, and wash away your sins BY calling on the name of the Lord." The word "by" is not in the original Greek texts. The focus is taken away the baptism and onto the prayer, as the action that washes away sins.  Maybe it is the teaching of the "sinner&#39;s prayer" by the mainly Southern Baptists who did the translating. Some say the HCSB means "Hard Core Southern Baptist." It casts doubt on what otherwise is a great translation.

<BR><BR>

Several times the Hebrew personal name of God, Yahweh, is used when His name is addressed.  Either use it in all places in the Old Testament, or not at all.

<BR><BR>


The HCSB also does not use gender-inclusive language unless the Hebrew and Greek allow it, and you will not see the "singular they" you will find in the 2011 NIV.
