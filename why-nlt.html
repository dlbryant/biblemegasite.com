<h3><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE NEW LIVING TRANSLATION</h3></center><P><P>
<BR><BR>

<h3> The main criticism of this translation is when does the translating end and when does the translators&#39; opinions, beliefs and doctrines begin.  The 2015 NLT rendering of Ephesians 2:8 is a good example of this. The broad use of paraphrasing makes it difficult to find out what the original text actually says, and therefore cannot be trusted as one's sole Bible.  The use of gender-inclusive language creates even more confusion.

<BR><BR>

The NLT does a good job of explaining difficult passages.  Ecclesiastes 12 is a prime example. Read it in most translations and compare it to the NLT and you will have your eyes opened. The NLT is great for comparison.  

<BR><BR>

One thing I am concerned about in reading the NLT is that many times they translate the word that means "faith" as "believe." Faith means both "believe" and "trust."  They should use "faith" to convey the double meaning.  We live by faith, not a mere believing.

<BR><BR>

While the NLT explains difficult passages, I cannot recommend it for for deep study, but as a comparision Bible for clarity and light reading, it is delightful to read.  While it is not the most accurate Bible, not by a long shot, it really speaks to me like no other translation.
