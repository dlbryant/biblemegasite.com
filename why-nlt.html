<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE NEW LIVING TRANSLATION</H1></center><P><P>
<BR><BR>

<h2> The main criticism of this translation is when does the translating end and when does the translator&#39;s opinions begins.  The 2013 NLT rendering of Ephesians 2:8 is a good example of this. The broad use of paraphrasing makes it difficult    to find out what the original text actually says, and therefore cannot be trusted.  The use of gender-inclusive language creates even more confusion.

<BR><BR>

The NLT does a good job of explaining difficult passages.  Ecclesiastes 12 is a prime example. Read it in most translations and compare it to the NLT and you will have your eyes opened.  

<BR><BR>

While the NLT explains difficult passages, I cannot recommend it for reading and definitely not for study.
