<font size=6><center><b>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE NEW LIVING TRANSLATION</center></b><P><P>
<BR><BR>

<font size=6> My main criticism of this translation is when does the translating end and when does the translators&#39; opinions, beliefs and doctrines begin.  The 2015 NLT rendering of Ephesians 2:8 is a good example of this.  But this is a problem with all phrase for phrase and thought for thought translations. Therefore the NLT should be used along with the NASB, ESV, or LSB. I never would use just one translation anyway.

<BR><BR>

The NLT does a very good job of explaining difficult passages.  Ecclesiastes 12 is a prime example. Read it in most translations and compare it to the NLT and you will have your eyes opened. The NLT is great for comparison.  

<BR><BR>

One thing I am concerned about in reading the NLT is that many times they translate the word that means "faith" as "believe." Faith means both "believe" and "trust."  They should use "faith" to convey the double meaning.  We live both believing and trusting, not a mere believing.

<BR><BR>

While the NLT explains difficult passages, I cannot recommend it for for deep Hebrew or Greek language study study, but as a comparision Bible to find the meaning and intent of a passage, it is delightful to read.  While it is not the most literal word for word Bible like the NASB, it really speaks to me like no other translation.  It is also a great to use with the Christian Standard Bible or the NET Bible.
