<h1><center>WHY I USE THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION, 2011 UPDATE</H1></center><P><P>


<BR><BR>

<h2> The new updated NIV has been accused of being a controversial and liberal Bible translation.  The new NIV maintains almost 92 percent of the very controversial Today&#39;s New International Version (TNIV). But in my opinion, much of the criticism of the new NIV has been unfounded.

<BR><BR>

The main criticism is about gender-inclusive language, use of male gender language when referring to passages that clearly refer to men and women. The Greek language has a neutral third person pronoun, unlike English. My opinion about such language is that gender-inclusive language is being used outside of translating the Bible.  When the Bible is translated into modern English, it should follow the rules of modern English grammar, and gender-inclusive language is one rule that will become standard in the near future. I think the singular "him" will be replaced by the singular "they" in English literature when referring to generic use of gender.  For years, I have used gender-inclusive language in my own writings.  Even the KJV uses such language when it translates "sons of God" as "children of God."  Frankly, I find Bibles that do not use gender-inclusive language as sounding unnatural with its constant use of male gender language when referring to passages that clearly refer to men and women. However, many gender-inclusive Bibles translate a word that is male-specific in the original languages and changes it to a gender-neutral word.  I oppose this. There is a difference between gender-accurate language and gender-neutral language (which is stripping the Bible of the male pronouns entirely).  The NIV rarely make changes in such fashion.  Another problem with these Bibles is the singular pronouns being replaced with plurals.  I don't mind this practice when the verses make it obvious that it is referring to a singular individual. I strongly believe that the NIV (2011 edition) does the best job in being gender-inclusive, that while it stumbles in places, is careful with changing pronouns while being clear that the verse is referring to a singular individual, and in most cases, only makes changes where the original permits.

<BR><BR>

The gender-inclusive language is much more conservative than the New Revised Standard Version or the New Living Translation.  An example is the term "adoption to sonship," which refers to the Roman practice of adopting a boy for the purpose of giving him full legal standing of an heir.   The NRSV and NLT say "adopted as children", while conservative non gender-inclusive versions say "adoption as sons."  The new NIV is far more accurate in its rendering. 

<BR><BR>

A welcome change is the replacement of "sinful nature" with "the flesh."  This is a literal rendering of the Greek word "sarx," and makes the NIV less Calvinistic. In Ephesians 5:19, the traditional "songs, hymns and spiritual songs" is replaced with "songs, hymns, and songs of the Spirit," referring to songs that are the product of a miraculous spiritual gift to members of the Ephesian church.  In 1 Corinthians 13:10, the new NIV correctly uses "when completion comes" (the completion of the written New Testament), instead of the 1984 NIV "when perfection comes," referring to the second coming of Christ. I believe the new NIV is correct in capitalizing the word "Spirit" in John 4:24.  The rendering "did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage" in Philippians 2:6 is far less confusing thsn other translations  "did not consider it robbery to be equal with God" or "did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped."

Some believe the NIV&#39;s rendering of Psalms 51:5 is teaching that a person is born in sin.  This verse is neither saying that King David was born in sin or that his mother was in sin when conceiving him (as in the King James Version).  The verse is not to be taken literally. The psalmist is using a figure of speech called hyperbole, a type of exaggeration.  Jesus used hyperbole when He said that if our hand causes us to sin, to cut it off. King David wrote this psalm after committing adultery with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah.  He uses hyperbole in verse five to reflect his current utter state of sinfulness.

<BR><BR>

Some believe the NIV&#39;s rendering of Romans 1:17 is teaching the false doctrine of "passive faith alone."  Salvation is truly "faith from beginning to end" in that we are to be "faithful until death" (Revelation 2:10), "we walk by faith, not by sight," (2 Corinthians 5:7), and that without faith, we cannot please God (Hebrews 11:6).  The NIV teaches in many verses about faith expressing itself in loving deeds (Galatians 5:6). 

<BR><BR>

Some believe that the NIV is teaching "passive faith alone" salvation in Romans 10:10. That is not the point of the passage!  Verse 9 drives the point home that one is saved by using their heart and their mouth.

<BR><BR>

Some believe the NIV says in Ephesians 1:13 is teaching that we are saved at the point of hearing the Gospel.  I think the NIV's rendering of the verse is basically saying that faith comes from hearing and hearing from the word of Christ (Romans 10:17).  The path to salvation always starts with hearing the Word, and that is what the NIV is saying in Ephesians 1:13, not that hearing is the only step of such a path of salvation.

<BR><BR>

Some believe that the NIV2011 differs from the NIV1984 in Romans 16:7 and 1 Corinthians 14:33-34 in such a way to promote feminism.  The New American Standard Bible translates those passages in the very same way, yet nobody accuses it of promoting feminism.

<BR><BR> 

The thing I enjoy about the new NIV the most is what the old NIV was famous for: its readability.  The new NIV is more accurate and just as readable than the old 1984 NIV. The beauty of the Bible does not rest in "thee"s, "thou"s. "-est"s or "-eth"s, but the fact that the Bible is our Creator&#39;s direct and loving message to us.  Translating the Bible into 21st century English does not diminish God's Word at all.  To hear the God's message with the same understanding, clarity and freshness as the original audience heard it is what makes the NIV special.

There are many more examples of improvement in the new NIV in the translator's notes of the new NIV, along with the policy and guidelines of the use of gender-inclusive language.  And there are two websites that tracked every change in the new NIV and how it differed from the 1984 NIV and the Today's New International Version.
