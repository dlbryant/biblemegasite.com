<font size=6><b><center>MY THOUGHTS ON THE APOCRYPHA AND PSEUDEPIGRAPHA</center></b>

<BR>

<font size=6> First of all, I&#39;m not a member of the churches that use the Apocrypha. I don&#39;t believe that the Apocrypha or pseudepigrapha were inspired by God as Holy Scripture like the 66 books of the Bible were. They were written between the time after Malachi was written and before the birth of Christ, and some around 100-300 AD.  It gives a great look into those times, both in literature, beliefs, history, and what many thought was Scripture. They are very interesting to read. While we can learn about a period of time from its literature, we should keep in mind that only the 66 books of the BIble are indeed perfectly Divine Scripture.
