<h1><center>WHAT I THINK OF THE APOCRYPHA</H1></center><P><P>

<h2> First of all, I&#39;m not Catholic.  While I don&#39;t believe that the Apocrypha was inspired by God as Holy Scripture like the 66 books of the Bible were, the Apocrypha was written between the time after Malachi was written and before the birth of Christ.  It gives a great look into those times, both in literature, beliefs, and history.  While the Apocrypha is not God's inspired scriptures, it is well worth reading.
