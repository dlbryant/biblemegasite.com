<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE NEW REVISED STANDARD VERSION</H1></center><P><P>


<BR><BR>

<h2>Two things ruin an otherwise good Bible translation.

<BR><BR>

First, this Bible was the first to use gender neutral language, stripping all generic references of male to a gender neutral language, even when the reference refers to males in the original languages. I strongly oppose this! An laughable instance is when they change "son" to "child" in Proverbs, even warning the genderless "child" about committing adultery to a woman! When does these Bible refer to msales only?  When does this Bible refer to singular or plural men or women? The NRSV goes too far with the gender neutral language!

<BR><BR>

Second, the NRSV Old Testament is translated without viewing the New Testament.  In other words, most New Testament prophecies are hidden in the Old Testament, msking it difficult fot the reader to find prophecies of Jesus in the Old Testament. A prime example of this are in Isaiah 7:14 and Psalms 34:20.


<BR><BR>

These two issues cripple what is otherwise a good translation.

Here is a good review of the NRSV:
