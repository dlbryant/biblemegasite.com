First, this Bible was the first to use gender neutral language, stripping all generic references of male to a gender neutral language, even when the reference refers to only males in the original languages. I strongly oppose this! A laughable instance is when they change "son" to "child" in Proverbs, even warning the genderless "child" about committing adultery to a "woman"! The NRSV changes "husband of one wife" to "married only once" in the passages about elders and deacons in an attempt to justify women in those offices. Often the NRSV changes singular pronouns to plural.  When does these Bible refer to males only?  When does this Bible refer to singular or plural men and/or women? The NRSV goes too far with the gender neutral language!

Second, the NRSV Old Testament is translated without considering the New Testament.  In other words, most New Testament fulfilled prophecies are hidden in the Old Testament, making it difficult for the reader to find prophecies of Jesus in the Old Testament. Prime examples of this are in Isaiah 7:14 and Psalms 34:20.

These two issues cripple what is otherwise a good translation.
