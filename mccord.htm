<font size=6> I would like to
recommend what is known as The Everlasting Gospel. It is a New Testament
(plus Genesis, Psalms, and Proverbs) translation by the late Hugo McCord. His degrees were A.A., B.A., M.A., B.D.,
and Th.D. He was a professor of Bible and Biblical Languages at Oklahoma
Christian College (now University), and served as adjunct professor at the
Alabama Christian School of Religion. His translation corrects several misunderstandings
in the New Testament. Hugo McCord's Fifth Edition is now available in hardcover (with bookmark ribbon)
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>and in software format for MAC and PC. For more details 
contact the Freed-Hardeman University Bible Store at 1-800-342-1869.</font> </p>
