<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE 2020 NEW AMERICAN STANDARD BIBLE</h1></center><P><P>

<BR><BR>

<h1> Considering that I have used the NASB2020 for one day, this reviews will be revised many times.

<BR><BR>

My first impression was that it is much easier to read and and less wooden or stilted than the NASB1995. The reading is more smooth. I did not enjoy reading the NASB1995, the NASB2020 is a joy to read. But it is definitely less literal than its 1995 counterpart. It is important to have a BIble ib your library that is very literal, and the NASB2020 is not it.  Thankfully the NASB1995 will still be in print, but remember when Biblica said that the 1984 NIV will be in print?  For a very literal translation, use the English Standard Version. 

<BR><BR>

John 3:16 has been heavily revised. But I believe that "God so loved the world" should be "This is how God loved the loved the world:" and that "His only Son" should be "His unique Son."  I know, not as beautiful rendering, but let's strive for accuracy first. I am pleased to see that the errors the NASB1995 made in Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9 have been corrected in the NASB2020.  

<BR><BR>

The NASB2020 uses some gender-accurae language, but "and sisters" in "brothers and sisters" is in italics to note that it is not in the original text.  And the "singular they" is not used, unlike the NIV2011. Singular pronouns are not made for plural ones, instead it uses the "singular him."  I like how the NASB2020 handles gender accuracy.

<BR><BR>

THe NASB is easy to read and is much like the Christian Standard Bible (my favorite Bible translation).  So far I have not found a passage that is not true to the original. Like I said, if you want a strict literal translation, then get a NASB1995 or the ESV.  If you want to read a Bible that balances readability and accuracy, then get the NASB2020 or the CSB. 

<BR><BR>

I will continue to read the NASB2020 and update this review.
