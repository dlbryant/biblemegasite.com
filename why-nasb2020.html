<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE 2020 NEW AMERICAN STANDARD BIBLE</h1></center><P><P>

<BR><BR>

<h1> Considering that I have used the NASB2020 for two days, this reviews will be revised many times.

<BR><BR>

My first impression was that it is much easier to read and and less wooden or stilted than the NASB1995. The reading is more smooth. I did not enjoy reading the NASB1995, the NASB2020 is a joy to read. The NASB2020 makes far more changes from the NASB1995 than the NASB1995 did from the NASB1977.  The NASB2020 is definitely less literal than its 1995 counterpart. It is important to have a Bible in your library that is very literal, and the NASB2020 is not it.  Thankfully the NASB1995 will still be in print, but remember when Biblica said that the 1984 NIV will be in print?  For a very literal translation, use the English Standard Version. If you want a Bible that is easy to read, but is fairly literal, then try the NASB2020.

<BR><BR>

John 3:16 has been heavily revised. But I believe that "God so loved the world" should be "This is how God loved the loved the world:" and that "His only Son" should be "His unique Son."  I know, not as beautiful rendering, but let's strive for accuracy first. I am pleased to see that the errors the NASB1995 made in Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9 have been corrected in the NASB2020. 1 Corinthians 13 also has changes. Almost every chapter in the NASB contain changes to make the text more readable. 

<BR><BR>

The NASB2020 uses some gender-accurate language, but "and sisters" in "brothers and sisters" is in italics to note that it is not in the original text.  And the "singular they" is not used, unlike the NIV2011. Singular pronouns are not made for plural ones, instead it uses the "singular him."  I like how the NASB2020 handles gender accuracy.

<BR><BR>

Like the NASB1995, the NASB2020 capitalizes nouns that refer to the Deity. THe original text does not do that, but it is useful to the reader. It also puts supplied words in italics, again very useful.  Old Testament quotes in the New Testament are put in all caps.

<BR><BR>

The NASB2020 is easy to read and is much like the Christian Standard Bible (my favorite Bible translation). The NASB2020 ia more literal than the CSB, but not as literal than the NASB 1995 or ESV.  So far I have not found a passage that is not true to the original. Like I said, if you want a strict literal translation, then get a NASB1995 or the ESV.  If you want to read a Bible that balances readability and accuracy, then get the NASB2020 or the CSB. 

<BR><BR>

I will continue to read the NASB2020 and update this review.
