<h1><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE CHRISTIAN STANDARD BIBLE</H1></center><P><P>

<BR<<BR>

<h2> The Christian Standard Bible is a new revision of the Holman Christian Standard Bible. I have read a few verses out of the CSB, and so far I like it,

<BR<BR>

The CSB is far better than the HCSB.  It corrects some of the weak or denominational bias in the HCSB, such as Acts 22:16 and Phillipians 2:13.  I was disappointed that the CSN does not capitalize the pronouns that refer to the Deity, like the HCSB did, which was useful.

<BR><BR>


The CSB has used more gender-accurate language than the HCSB, but does not use gender-inclusive language unless the Hebrew and Greek allow it, and you will not see the "singular they" you will find in the 2011 NIV.

<BR><BR>

Here are a couple of reviews of the HCSB, and you will find that the CSB corrects most of the verses mentioned in the review: <BR><BR>
