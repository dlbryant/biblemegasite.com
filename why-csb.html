<h3><center>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE CHRISTIAN STANDARD BIBLE</h3></center><P><P>

<BR<<BR>

<h3> The Christian Standard Bible is a new revision of the Holman Christian Standard Bible. 

<BR<BR>

The CSB is far better than the HCSB.  It corrects some of the weak or denominational bias in the HCSB, such as Acts 22:16 and Phillipians 2:13.  I was disappointed that the CSN does not capitalize the pronouns that refer to the Deity, like the HCSB did, which was useful.

<BR><BR>


I found a verse that makes me distrust the whole CSB.  It is Ephesians 1:13.  One has to understand the theme of the book to understand this verse.  The theme is God revealing through the Good News that Gentiles are included in God's grand scheme.

<BR><BR>

Here is the NIV rendering of verse 13:

<BR><BR>

13 And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,

<BR><BR>

The NIV nails it.  After addressing the Jews, Paul is now addressing the Gentiles and tells them that they will hear the Good News that the Gentiles are now included in God's grand plan, and once they believe (obey and become Christians), they are sealed with the Holy Spirit.

<BR><BR>

Now here's the CSB:

<BR><BR>

13 In him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed. 
 
<BR><BR>

The order is reversed,  The Gentiles were not sealed with the Holy Spirit until AFTER they believed (become Christians), not when merely after hearing they are now included with the Jews.  Compare other major translations and you will not find the order reversed like the CSB.  I believe that this is more than an oversight, but a false doctrine that crept into this verse.  I cannot trust the CSB after this. 


<BR><BR>


The CSB has used more gender-accurate language than the HCSB, but does not use gender-inclusive language unless the Hebrew and Greek allow it, and you will not see the "singular they" you will find in the 2011 NIV.

<BR><BR>

The CSB corrects most of the verses of the HCSB, but their handling (mishandling) of Ephesians 1:13 is unforgivable. <BR><BR>
