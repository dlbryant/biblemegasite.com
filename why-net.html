<font size=6><center><b>DAVID&#39;S REVIEW OF THE NEW ENGLISH TRANSLATION (NET BIBLE)</center></b><P><P>


<BR><BR>

<font size=6>  The NET Bible is different for several reasons, the most obvious being that it has over 63,000 translators notes that explains the whole translating process behind this Bible.

<BR><BR>

The NET Bible was translated by far less people than other Bible translating committees, and most of the NET Bible&#39;s translators were from the same school, Dallas Theological Seminary.  I would prefer a committee to be of different and widespread denominations from several schools to prevent one religion from inserting their beliefs in their translation.

<BR><BR>

The notes are more literal than the Bible text itself.  The translation is very insightful than most translations, and the notes are even more so.

<BR><BR> 

It does have gender-inclusive language, but not as much as the New Revised Standard Version.  Like the NRSV, they translate the Old Testament without regard to the New Testament.

<BR><BR> 

Here's the worst example:


<BR><BR>

 Isaiah 7:14 New International Version (NIV)

Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.

<BR><BR>


 Isaiah 7:14 New English Translation (NET Bible)

For this reason the Lord himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel.


<BR><BR>


While I understand why the NET Bible has rendered the verse the way they did, the translators had to do a lot of guesswork and it is impossible to tell that it is also about the virgin Mary giving birth to Jesus.

<BR><BR>

Other than that verse, I would recommend the NET Bible as an companion with a more literal translation.
