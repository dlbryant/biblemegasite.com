<h1><center>SUMMARY OF HOW THE HOLY SPIRIT WORKS AND DWELLS IN US</center></h1>

<h1>

When asked about the Holy Spirit, I answer that the Holy Spirit is the personality of God embodied and personified by a Divine Body. When Christian is filled with the Spirit, they greatly display the personality traits of the Holy Spirit, as described by Paul as the fruit of the Spirit:
<BR><BR>

Galatians 5:22-23
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.



<BR><BR>


What does the Holy Spirit do today? The Word of God is God-breathed by the Holy Spirit (2 Timothy 3:16). The Holy Spirit changes people's hearts with the Word. The Spirit works though His powerful Word. The Spirit communicates His personality through the Word. The Spirit dwells in us through the word.  

<BR><BR>


Read John chapters 14-16..everything about the Holy Spirit in these chapters can be said of God's Word.


<BR><BR>

In Ephesians, the Word is described as the Sword of the Spirit. But don't be confused, the Spirit is NOT the same as the Word.

<BR><BR>

Let me give you example...I chopped down a tree with an ax.  Am I the ax?  Of course not. I worked through an ax to chop down a tree. Same with the Spirit. He works through the Word which touches hearts.

<BR><BR>

Let's deal with the myths.  The Spirit does not speak in tongues today, especially in babbling nonsense.  Read in Acts 2 about the apostles speaking in all the languages of the foreigners who attended the Pentecost to listen to the apostles.  Paul later needed this gift as he traveled to places where he didn't know the local language. 

<BR><BR>

But according to 1 Corinthians 13 that tongues as an incomplete gift would cease once the perfect gift would come...the completion of the written New Testament. Now we have many foreign language translations of the Bible, which makes tongues no longer needed.

<BR><BR>

There were people who had special knowledge through the Spirit. Again, this was before the complete New Testament was written. Those people that had hands laid on them had complete knowledge of the entire New Testament so they can teach it. Again, 1 Corinthians says special knowledge will cease when the complete came. Again all that knowledge we need for salvation is in the Bible. 

<BR><BR>


Some will say the Spirit does little today...nonsense! Billions of people have become Christians through the Sword of the Spirit, and many of them change their lives, changed their family's lives, and have changed their corner of the world.   I do believe that one can be filled with the Holy Spirit by our obedience to the Spirit-inspired Word.
<BR><BR>

But remember, the Spirit only dwells us when we obey on God's terms, as mentioned by the Bible (Acts 2:38).

<BR><BR>

Galatians 5:25
Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
